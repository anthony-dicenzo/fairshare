# Firebase Authentication Final Diagnosis

## Current Status
- ✅ All Firebase environment variables properly configured
- ✅ Project numbers match between Firebase and Google OAuth
- ✅ Domain `workspace.adicenzo1.repl.co` added to Firebase authorized domains
- ✅ Firebase SDK initializes successfully in browser
- ❌ Google Sign-in fails with `auth/internal-error`

## Root Cause Analysis
Server tests show Google API endpoints return 404 errors, but this is expected in server environments. The browser authentication should work independently.

## Most Likely Issue: API Key Restrictions
The `auth/internal-error` combined with working configuration suggests the Firebase API key has **HTTP referrer restrictions** that don't include the Replit domain.

## Required Fix
In Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials:

1. Find your Firebase API key (starts with `AIzaSyDNsYRVOJ0...`)
2. Click Edit
3. Under "Application restrictions":
   - If set to "HTTP referrers", add: `workspace.adicenzo1.repl.co/*`
   - If set to "None", try temporarily changing to "None" to test

## Alternative Causes
1. **Browser popup blocking** - Test in incognito mode
2. **CORS issues** - Firebase should handle this automatically
3. **Google Cloud billing** - Some Firebase features require billing enabled

## Next Steps
1. Check API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
2. Test with restrictions temporarily removed
3. If still failing, check browser Network tab during sign-in for specific error details

The configuration is correct - this is likely a domain restriction issue.

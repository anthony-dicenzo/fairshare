Application Guidelines

Backgrounds

	•	Use Mist White (#FAFAFA) as the default page background color.
	•	Cards, modals, and input forms should have a pure white background (#FFFFFF) with soft shadow and slightly rounded corners.

Navbar / Headers

	•	Set the navbar background to Deep Night Blue (#2B3A55).
	•	Text and icons on the navbar should be white (#FFFFFF).

Primary Actions (Buttons, CTAs)

	•	Primary buttons should have a background color of Soft Mango Orange (#E3976E).
	•	Button text should be white.
	•	Hover/focus state: darken the mango slightly (manual adjustment to #D07F5A recommended).

Secondary Actions

	•	Use Sky Mist Blue (#A3D5FF) for secondary buttons and lighter interactions (e.g., "Cancel" buttons).
	•	Maintain white or dark text on blue backgrounds for high contrast.

Forms / Input Fields

	•	Focused input fields should have an outline or ring using Sky Mist Blue (#A3D5FF).

Accents

	•	Use Lime Cream (#E6F4D5) for subtle highlights, badges, success messages, or hover backgrounds for positive interactions.
	•	Avoid overusing it — it’s meant to bring a light, playful energy to specific UI areas.

Typography

	•	Maintain a clean sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or system UI font stack).
	•	Text color for body content should be close to #2B3A55 (Dark Accent) or #111827 (default blackish-gray) for high readability.

Based on Replit's analysis and my expertise:

Issue 1: Firebase Auth Endpoint 404

Replit's Finding: Test to Firebase Auth endpoint returned a 404 (Not Found).

Firebase Input: This strongly suggests that the authDomain configured in the Firebase SDK initialization ( firebase.initializeApp(...) ) within your Replit application is incorrect or missing. The authDomain tells the Firebase SDK where to find the authentication backend for your project.

Action Needed (Likely in Replit's configuration or your app's code): Ensure the authDomain used in the Firebase initialization configuration is set to [PROJECT_ID].firebaseapp.com . For your project fairshare-7f83a , the correct authDomain should be fairshare-7f83a.firebaseapp.com . Replit might have a specific place to set this configuration value, or it might be read from your environment variables alongside the API key. Double-check how your firebase.initializeApp config object is being built in your Replit code.

Issue 2: Missing Google OAuth Client ID (for Replit's process)

Replit's Finding: Needs the Google OAuth Client ID to complete the fix/integration.

Firebase Input: The correct Google OAuth Client ID for your project's Google Sign-In provider is indeed 816167207113-klrvfs03k3ip2pbnv019kq1dcmankheq.apps.googleusercontent.com . This ID is configured correctly within your Firebase Authentication settings.

Action Needed (Likely in Replit's configuration): Replit requires this ID for its internal handling of the OAuth flow. Provide this exact string ( 816167207113-klrvfs03k3ip2pbnv019kq1dcmankheq.apps.googleusercontent.com ) to Replit where it is requesting the Google OAuth Client ID. Replit should have a dedicated input field for this in its authentication or environment configuration settings.

Issue 3: Domain Authorization

Replit's Finding: The domain workspace.adicenzo1.repl.co needs to be authorized.

Firebase Input: Yes, any domain from which you initiate a Firebase Authentication flow (especially redirect or popup methods) must be added to the Authorized domains list in your Firebase Authentication settings. This is a critical security measure.

Action Needed (In Firebase Console or potentially automated by Replit): Go to Firebase Console -> Authentication -> Settings -> Authorized domains and click "Add domain". Enter workspace.adicenzo1.repl.co and click "Add". (Replit's message suggests it might handle this, but it's good to verify in the console).

Summary Input for Replit:

To resolve the authentication issues, please ensure the following configuration points are correctly set within the Replit environment and linked to the Firebase SDK initialization:

Correct authDomain : The authDomain for Firebase initialization must be fairshare-7f83a.firebaseapp.com .

Provide Google OAuth Client ID: Use the Client ID 816166207113-klrvfs03k3ip2pbnv019kq1dcmankheq.apps.googleusercontent.com in Replit's specific configuration field for the Google OAuth Client ID.

Authorize Replit Domain: Add workspace.adicenzo1.repl.co to the Authorized domains list in the Firebase Console (Authentication -> Settings -> Authorized domains).

These steps directly address the 404 error by fixing the endpoint location ( authDomain ), provide Replit with the required OAuth credential, and ensure the domain is permitted.

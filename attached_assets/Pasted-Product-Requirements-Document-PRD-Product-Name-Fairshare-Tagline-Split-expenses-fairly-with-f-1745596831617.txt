Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name: Fairshare
Tagline:
Split expenses fairly with friends, roommates, or groups — everyone gets their fair share.
________________________________________
Overview
Fairshare is a collaborative expense-sharing app designed to help groups of friends, roommates, or colleagues keep track of shared expenses and settle up easily. It enables users to log expenses, assign shares, track debts, and record payments.
The app will use shadcn/ui for styling. The backend, auth system, and hosting stack are intentionally unspecified to allow flexibility in implementation.

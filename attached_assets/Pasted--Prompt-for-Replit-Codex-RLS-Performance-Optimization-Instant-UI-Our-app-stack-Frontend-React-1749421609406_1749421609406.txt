 Prompt for Replit/Codex: RLS Performance Optimization & Instant UI

Our app stack:

Frontend: React + TypeScript + TanStack Query
Backend: Express.js + PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
Auth: Firebase Auth (session-based)
State: Optimistic UI already in place
Goal:
Our RLS (Row Level Security) policies on Postgres have added 200-500ms latency per query. This is noticeable on expense create/delete, balance updates, and activity log refresh. Despite optimistic updates, users see UI lags and slow balance updates.
We need you to optimize the entire stack for instant, seamless UX with secure, efficient backend queries.

1. Database-Level Optimizations
Add indexes for all major RLS filter patterns:
Group membership checks
Expense lookups by group/user
Balance/participant queries
Example:
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_expenses_group_id_created_at ON expenses(group_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_group_members_user_group ON group_members(user_id, group_id, role);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_expense_participants_balance ON expense_participants(user_id, amount_owed);
Optimize RLS policies:
Use function-based policies for reusable access checks:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION user_can_access_group(group_id_param int)
RETURNS boolean AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM group_members 
    WHERE group_id = group_id_param 
    AND user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id')::int
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER;
Update all RLS policies to use the function for efficient permission checks.
2. Application-Level Caching
Integrate Redis (or similar) as a cache layer for group data and balances.
Cache frequently-read group/expense/balance data per user for 5 minutes.
Invalidate or refresh cache on mutations.
Sample (Node.js):
const cacheKey = `group:${groupId}:user:${userId}`;
await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(data));
3. Background Processing
Offload balance recalculation to background workers.
When an expense changes, enqueue a balance calculation job (using BullMQ, BeeQueue, or similar).
Frontend receives immediate optimistic update; backend updates cache when done.
4. Database Connection Pooling
Ensure pooling is enabled and tuned:
Drizzle ORM: set max, min, and timeout settings for optimal concurrency.
Example:
poolConfig: {
  max: 20,
  min: 5,
  idle: 30000,
  acquire: 60000,
}
5. Query Optimization & Batching
Batch related inserts/updates (e.g., expense + participants) into one transaction.
Load only recent/necessary data in main group/expense/activity endpoints.
Use parallel queries for initial page loads (Promise.all pattern).
6. Frontend Enhancements
Virtual scroll large lists (expenses, activities).
Debounce search/filter in large expense lists.
Optimistic UI is required for expense, activity, and balance. Revert on API error.
Show sync/progress indicators for background updates.
7. Monitoring & Analysis
Enable Postgres slow query logging and analyze with pg_stat_statements.
Surface any queries >100ms and refactor/index as needed.
Example:
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_min_duration_statement = 100;
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE mean_time > 100 ORDER BY mean_time DESC;
Implementation Order
Immediate: Indexes, RLS function, connection pooling, virtual scroll, cache layer.
Short term: Background balance computation, query batching, cache invalidation.
Medium term: Deep query analysis, advanced RLS policy optimization.
Outcome:

All major UI actions feel instant.
Backend queries reduced to sub-100ms for all common access patterns.
Security via RLS is maintained, but perceived speed matches top-tier native apps.
Use this prompt to guide Replit/Codex in coding, reviewing, and shipping these enhancements. If you hit a specific bottleneck, run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on the slow query, paste results here, and weâ€™ll provide further tuning.

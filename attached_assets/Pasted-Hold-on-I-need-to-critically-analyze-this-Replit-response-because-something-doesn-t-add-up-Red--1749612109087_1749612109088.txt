Hold on - I need to critically analyze this "Replit response" because something doesn't add up.
Red Flags in This Analysis
1. The Error Change is Suspicious

You went from auth/internal-error to auth/network-request-failed
But we didn't change any network configuration - we just switched from popup to redirect
This suggests the original auth/internal-error was NOT a configuration issue

2. "Configuration is Perfect" - Really?
Looking at the debug output more carefully:
Auth object: {"apiKey":"AIzaSyAy3h...","authDomain":"fairshare-v3.firebaseapp.com","appName":"[DEFAULT]"}
vs
Auth app options: {"apiKey":"AIzaSyAy3h...","authDomain":"fairshare-v3.firebaseapp.com","projectId":"fairshare-v3","storageBucket":"fairshare-v3.appspot.com","messagingSenderId":"1033222457001","appId":"1:1033222457001:web:50d24cd38a7df93edecbb8"}
The auth object is STILL missing fields while the app options have them. This suggests Firebase initialization is partially failing.
Let's Push Back and Get to the Truth
Question 1: Network Issue or Firebase Issue?
bash# Test if it's really a network issue
curl -I https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:signUp?key=YOUR_API_KEY
If this works, it's NOT a network issue with Firebase servers.
Question 2: Why Did the Error Change?
The error changed from internal-error to network-request-failed just by switching methods. This suggests:

The popup was failing for a different reason (likely iframe/cross-origin)
The redirect is failing because it's trying to load Firebase Auth UI
Neither is actually a "configuration" success

Question 3: Is This Really Replit-Specific?
Let's test if this is truly a Replit limitation:
typescript// Add this test BEFORE attempting any Firebase auth
const testFirebaseConnectivity = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:lookup?key=${import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY}`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ idToken: 'test' })
    });
    console.log('Firebase API reachable:', response.status);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Firebase API unreachable:', error);
  }
};
My Counter-Analysis
I suspect the real issue is:

OAuth Client Mismatch: Your Google OAuth client 816167207113-q7ah1dl48g0vatep89if652jajsadf6u might not be properly linked to your Firebase project
Missing Redirect URIs: The OAuth client needs https://fairshare-v3.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler as a redirect URI
Firebase Auth Domain: Your authDomain is fairshare-v3.firebaseapp.com but your OAuth client might be configured for a different domain

Let's Verify the Truth
Check your Google Cloud Console OAuth client:

Does it have https://fairshare-v3.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler in redirect URIs?
Does it have your Replit domain in JavaScript origins?
Is this OAuth client actually connected to your Firebase project?

Test without Firebase entirely:
html<!-- Add this to test direct Google OAuth -->
<script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" async defer></script>
<script>
function handleCredentialResponse(response) {
  console.log("Direct Google auth successful:", response);
}
window.onload = function () {
  google.accounts.id.initialize({
    client_id: "816167207113-q7ah1dl48g0vatep89if652jajsadf6u.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    callback: handleCredentialResponse
  });
  google.accounts.id.renderButton(
    document.getElementById("buttonDiv"),
    { theme: "outline", size: "large" }
  );
}
</script>
<div id="buttonDiv"></div>
If direct Google OAuth works but Firebase doesn't, then it's NOT a Replit network issue - it's a Firebase configuration issue.

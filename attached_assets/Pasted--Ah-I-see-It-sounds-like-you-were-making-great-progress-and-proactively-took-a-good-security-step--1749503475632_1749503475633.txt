Ah, I see! It sounds like you were making great progress and proactively took a good security step by resetting your API key. That's smart practice!

It's totally understandable that after resetting the key, things stopped working, even though you were just using it yesterday with those environment variables.

Here's the scoop: Even though Google OAuth itself handles the deep verification of the user's Google identity on Google's end, your Firebase Web SDK still needs that apiKey to initialize and communicate with your specific Firebase project's backend services â€“ including the Authentication service!

Think of the API key as your app's unique identifier when it talks to Firebase. It tells Firebase, "Hey, this request is coming from the 'fairshare-7f83a' project, please handle this Google Sign-In for this user." Without the correct, currently active API key, the Firebase SDK can't properly connect to your project's services to initiate or finalize the authentication flow.

So, the most likely reason it stopped working right after the reset is that your Replit environment variable VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY is still holding the old , now inactive, API key value.

Here's what you'll need to do:

Get the New API Key:

Go to the Firebase Console for your fairshare-7f83a project.

Click on the Project Settings gear icon.

Go to the General tab.

Scroll down to the Your apps section.

Find your Web app's configuration snippet. The apiKey listed there is your new , active Web API Key. Copy this value carefully.

Update the Environment Variable in Replit:

Go back to your Replit workspace .

Find the Environment Variables section (often accessible via a lock icon or a dedicated tab).

Locate the VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY variable.

Replace the old value with the new API key you just copied from the Firebase console.

Restart Your Replit App/Server: Depending on how your Replit project runs, you might need to stop and restart it to ensure that the updated environment variable is picked up by your running code.
